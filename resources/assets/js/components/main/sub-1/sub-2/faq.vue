                        <p>DND stands for Do-Not-Disturb. A service introduced by Nigerian Communication Commission (NCC) that enables mobile subscribers to opt out of marketing/promotional messages of which bulk SMS is classified as one. Hence, mobile numbers on the DND list are not able to receive bulk SMS via the regular route.

                        To deliver to DND numbers, we make use of a Corporate Route. The messages are sent to the numbers provided, then the phone numbers blocked by the network providers will be retried over the Corporate Route. <br>
                        However, you can specify that all messages be delivered over the Corporate Route, <strong> <i>please note that this will attract double the units required to send the messages. </i> </strong>
                        <br>
                        Please, note that the Sender ID could be changed for only DND numbers. <br>

                        Text 'STATUS' to '2442' to check your DND status (for all networks in Nigeria). <br>
                        To opt out of DND, <br>
                        on MTN text 'ALLOW' to '2442', <br>
                        on GLO text 'CANCEL' to '2442', <br>

                            First step is to have sufficient credit for the amount of messages to be sent. 😎<br> <br>

                            Once that is covered, the next step is to settile on the Sender ID to be used. <br> <br>

                            What is sender ID ❓ <br>
                            📓 Sender ID is the customize name you want your message to deliver as on the recipient line. <br> For Example: 💑 TUNDEOPE18 💑, ☂️ PDP ⛱️, 🐵 LasisiElenu 🙈, 🇳🇬 Buhari 🇳🇬, 💰 30BG 💲, and so on. <br>
                            NOTE: The sender ID can only contain 11 characters at maximum. Don't try your luck, we are watching you.
                            <br> <br>

                            Next Step: The Message Type <br>
                            As you know, SMS is supported by almost all mobile devices and mobile networks (GSM and others) in the world. An SMS message can contain a short text only, and can be sent to any cellphone number around the world. SMS messages are routed internationally. <br> <strong> PLAIN SMS </strong> Plain SMS can contain standard text format, its standard length is 160 characters. <br> <strong> FLASH SMS </strong> Flash SMS is also called Class0 SMS. It display only SMS. On most mobile phones it is displayed immediately and is never saved to the SIM card or your phone memory without your prior permission. Don’t change this option except you know what you’re doing. <br> <br>

                            The Recipients: <br>
                            This is the column where you type or paste the phone numbers you wish to forward messages to. The number must be separated by (a comma, space or putting each number on a line). <br>
                            Also beside the Recipients column, you can also select contacts from your existing phone book which has been saved on the website. <br>
                            Finally you can upload a text(.txt) or a (.csv) file which have been perfectly separated as recipients by line, this is very important. Please note that you can use all or any of the available options to add your recipients. <br> Please note that any other file formats such as csv are not supported and will give an error. <br> <br>

                            Next: Messages <br> This is the simplest part.<i> The maximum number of characters per page of SMS message is 160 characters. </i> <br>

                            Lastly, Scheduling Messages: <br>
                            After clicking the "SEND MESSAGE" button, a metrics report on the message you want to send would be generated and you can switch over tot the overview tab to include a scheduled date. <br> By default none will be entered for you. <br>
                            You don’t really want to miss wishing your loved ones on special occasion like: birthdays, religious celebrations etc. do you?  Hence, you can prepare for such events with this option;
